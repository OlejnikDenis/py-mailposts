Implemented user authorization by username and password.
Ideally hash passwords and store it only, 
but within the framework of the course work it was allowed to do just.

When you try to change something in the database, the system also checks 
if the user is currently authorized as an administrator.

If the user is authorized as an admin, he has full access to the database.
